\section{System Design Principles}

\paragraph{Design principles applicable to many areas}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Adopt sweeping simplifications} \\
  So you can see what you are doing.

\item \textbf{Avoid excessive generality} \\
  If it is good for everything it is good for nothing

\item \textbf{Avoid rarely used components} \\
  Deterioration and corruption accumulate unnoticed - until next use.

\item \textbf{Be explicit} \\
  Get all of the assumptions out on the table

\item \textbf{Decouple modules with indirection} \\
  Indirection supports replaceability

\item \textbf{End-to-end argument} \\
  The application knows best

\item \textbf{Escalating complexity principle} \\
  Adding a feature increases complexity out of proportion

\item \textbf{Incommensurate scaling rule} \\
  Changing a parameter by a factor of ten requires a new design

\item \textbf{Keep digging principle} \\
  Complex systems fail for complex reasons

\item \textbf{Law of diminishing returns} \\
  The more one improves some measure of goodness, the more effort
  the next improvement will require

\item \textbf{Open design principle} \\
  Let anyone comment on the design; you need all the help you can get

\item \textbf{Principle of least astonishment} \\
  People are part of the system. Choose interfaces that match the
  user's experience, expectations, and mental models

\item \textbf{Robustness principle} \\
  Be tolerant of inputs, strict on outputs

\item \textbf{Safety margin principle} \\
  Keep track of the distance to the edge of the cliff or you may fall
  over the edge

\item \textbf{Unyielding foundations rule} \\
  It is easier to change a module than to change the modularity
\end{itemize}
