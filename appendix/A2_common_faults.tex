\section{Common Faults, Misc}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{safety vs. security:}
  when a question asks about
  safety of a system it means it robustness, how well it
  can tolerate faults etc. and not about security with adversary etc.
\item when drawing schedule (no overlapping operations!)
\item over engineering in design question / misunderstanding the question
\end{itemize}
